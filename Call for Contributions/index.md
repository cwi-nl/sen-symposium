## Call for Lightning Talks

We invite all software engineering researchers and practitioners in the Netherlands to contribute to the symposium program. We welcome proposals for "lightning talks" - short but engaging presentations, to be allocated between 5 and 10 minutes at the symposium.

There is no specific format for lightning talks. Still, they should be targeting the broad VERSEN audience. An exciting lightning talk may, for instance:

* Describe recently published results; 
* Present open research problems (and/or ongoing efforts to tackle them); 
* Summarize a recently concluded PhD dissertation;
* Summarize the bachelor or master thesis you are working on;
* Recently granted (or started) research projects;
* Motivate a "call to arms" for the broad VERSEN community. 

There will be a (lightweight) evaluation of one-page talk proposals (PDF) describing the envisioned presentation at the symposium.

_The link for the submission will be available soon._

<!--- Please submit your one-page proposal (PDF) using HotCRP.
