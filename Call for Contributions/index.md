<!-- ## Call for Lightning Talks

We invite all software engineering researchers and practitioners in the Netherlands to contribute to the symposium program. We welcome proposals for "lightning talks" - short but engaging presentations, to be allocated between 5 and 10 minutes at the symposium.


There is no specific format for lightning talks. Still, they should be targeting the broad VERSEN audience. An exciting lightning talk may, for instance:

* Describe recently published results;
* Present open research problems (and/or ongoing efforts to tackle
them);
* Summarize a recently concluded PhD dissertation;
* Summarize bachelor/master thesis you are working on;
* Recently granted (or started) research projects;
* Motivate a "call to arms" for the broad VERSEN community.  

There will be a (lightweight) evaluation of one-page talk proposals
(PDF) describing the envisioned presentation at the symposium.

Please submit your one-page proposal (PDF) using HotCRP.

### Important Dates

Submission of talk proposals: May 17th, 23:59 (CEST).

Notification: May 21st.

We look forward to seeing you at the SEN symposium! -->
