[![alt text](logo.png)](https://www.cwi.nl/ "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica")
### Navigation system

The street name ‘Science Park’ is in use since 2011 and is not yet implemented in all navigation systems. If you cannot find ‘Science Park 123’, use our the address ‘Kruislaan 413’ instead.

### Directions

* Exit the A10 ringroad at S113/Watergraafsmeer.
* Follow the Science Park signs, these will direct you to the Kruislaan.
* Turn left onto the Carolina MacGillavrylaan after passing through the railroad tunnel
* Take the Science Park entry at your right and enter the gate Parking

You can park your car at any parking lot after the gate. Follow the signs to number 123, our main entrance. Parking is paid after one hour but you can pick up a free exit card at the reception of the symposium in the morning. Please hold on to the card you receive when entering the gate _and_ the free exit card. You will need both to leave the terrain.


## How to reach CWI by public transport

### Train

CWI is a five minute walk away from NS station Amsterdam Science Park. This station is served four times an hour from the directions Amsterdam Centraal – Schiphol and Almere – Amersfoort.

Walk through the tunnel after leaving the platform, cross the street (Carolina MacGillavrylaan) at the crosswalk and walk past the brown building of Amsterdam University College. You will be able to see CWI’s main entrance on your left behind the parking lot.

### Bus

Alternatively, bus 40 serves Amsterdam Science Park four times an hour from stations Amsterdam Amstel (train, metro, tram) and Amsterdam Muiderpoort (train, tram). Get off at Science Park Aqua.

### Tram

Take tram 9 to Diemen at Amsterdam Central Station. Get off at Kruislaan (situated at the Middenlaan - Kruislaan intersection). From there, you can walk to Amsterdam Science Park (15 min) or switch to bus 40.
