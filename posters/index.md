This call aims to attract high-class elevator pitches and posters for the SEN symposium on January 20st, 2017.

We solicit for:

Elevator pitch - The name 'elevator pitch' reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver a summary of your work in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to three minutes. We aim to accept high quality 3-minute pitches by young researchers (academic age 2-7, including all research years). Please submit your one-page summary of the research work you want to pitch to easychair. Proposals must include topic, presenter, one paragraph CV, and novelty. All posters will receive a basic sanity check. New ways of engaging the audience are encouraged, voting cards (red and green) will be made available to attendants at the event.

Posters - We welcome all researchers and research related organizations to present their software-related research/aims/marketing messages on an A[0,1] poster. Please note that the poster sessions will be lengthy enough to engage the audience. All posters will receive a basic sanity check.

We look forward to seeing your submissions here: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sen2017

Important dates:

Deadline: before 1-12-2016, anywhere in the world.

Notification: 1-1-2017, pitches and posters have a high chance of acceptance.
